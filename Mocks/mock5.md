  **Answer:** C. A digital certificate cannot ensure that one public key is possessed by only one owner in digital signature
    
  **Answer Analysis:**
    - This statement is incorrect. Digital certificates do ensure that a public key belongs to a specific owner by binding the key to the identity through the CA's digital signature.

### 46. Which of the following is not an advantage of symmetric encryption algorithms?

  A. High efficiency  
  B. Low cost  
  C. Good scalability  
  D. Suitable for encrypting a large amount of data  
  
  <details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** C. Good scalability
    
  **Answer Analysis:**
    - Symmetric encryption has poor scalability due to the key distribution problem. As the number of parties increases, the number of required keys grows exponentially, making key management difficult.

### 47. Which of the following is not an external security threat faced by enterprises?

  A. Network scanning  
  B. DDoS attack  
  C. Phishing email  
  D. Terminal vulnerability  
  
  <details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** D. Terminal vulnerability
    
  **Answer Analysis:**
    - Terminal vulnerability is an internal security threat related to endpoint devices within the organization. Network scanning, DDoS attacks, and phishing emails are external threats originating from outside the organization.

### 48. Which of the following types of packets cannot be filtered by a packet filtering firewall?

  A. Non-initial fragments  
  B. Non-fragmented packets  
  C. Forged ICMP error packets  
  D. Initial fragments  
  
  <details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** A. Non-initial fragments
    
  **Answer Analysis:**
    - Packet filtering firewalls cannot effectively filter non-initial fragments because these fragments don't contain the complete header information (like port numbers) needed for filtering decisions.

### 49. Which of the following statements is incorrect about DoS attacks?

  A. DoS attacks stop services or resource access on the target server  
  B. DoS attacks cause unrecoverable physical damage to the target server  
  C. DoS attacks force the target server's buffer to be full and does not receive new requests  
  D. DoS attacks use IP spoofing to prevent authorized users from connecting to the target server  
  
  <details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** B. DoS attacks cause unrecoverable physical damage to the target server
    
  **Answer Analysis:**
    - This statement is incorrect. DoS attacks cause logical/software-based service disruptions, not physical hardware damage. They overwhelm resources but don't physically damage the server hardware.

### 50. Which of the following is not a function of digital envelope?

  A. It solves the problem of releasing symmetric keys  
  B. It solves the problem of slow symmetric key encryption  
  C. It improves security, scalability, and efficiency  
  D. It ensures the security of symmetric keys  
  
  <details>
  <summary>Show Answer</summary>
  **Answer:** B. It solves the problem of slow symmetric key encryption
    
  **Answer Analysis:**
    - Digital envelopes don't solve the problem of slow symmetric encryption. In fact, they use symmetric encryption for the actual data because it's faster than asymmetric encryption. Digital envelopes address key distribution, not encryption speed.
