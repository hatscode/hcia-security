            "High overhead",
            "The application layer is responsible for reliability."
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 0,
          "explanation": "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides connection-oriented and reliable byte stream services. Connection-oriented means that two applications using TCP must establish a TCP connection before exchanging data. TCP provides reliable transmission services through mechanisms such as acknowledgment, error checking, and data reassembly. However, these mechanisms introduce significant overhead. TCP is not unreliable; that characteristic applies to UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The application layer is not responsible for TCP's reliability; TCP itself ensures this through its own mechanisms."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 0,
          "explanation": "An IP address is a 32-bit logical address, not a hardware address. A hardware address, such as a 48-bit MAC address, is fixed in the network interface card (NIC) and used for communication between devices on the same link. The MAC address is globally unique, whereas IP addresses can be either public or private. Public IP addresses are globally unique, while private IP addresses can be reused within a LAN. The MAC address cannot be easily modified by common users."

            "Right",
            "Wrong"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "The TCP/IP protocol stack consists of five layers, not seven. The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) reference model consists of seven layers. The layers in the TCP/IP model are: Application, Transport, Internet, Network Interface, and Physical. The layers in the OSI model are: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical."

            "MAC address table",
            "ARP table",
            "Session table"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 3,
          "explanation": "The firewall uses the session table to record the connection status of TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols. This table helps the firewall track and manage ongoing sessions, allowing it to forward packets based on their connection status. A session represents the connection status between two communication parties on the firewall."

            "Local"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 3,
          "explanation": "The Local zone, provided by the firewall, represents the firewall itself. This zone is used for handling packets that need to be responded to and processed by the firewall, rather than forwarded. Due to its unique role, security policies between the local zone and itself often need to be configured for applications requiring the device to send and receive packets."

            "Wrong"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "The basic design principle of a firewall is that traffic not explicitly allowed is discarded by default. This principle ensures that only permitted traffic is allowed through, thus protecting the network from unauthorized access and potential threats."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 0,
          "explanation": "No-Port Address Translation (NAT No-PAT) translates only addresses and does not translate ports. In this way, one-to-one private address and one-to-one public address are translated. Easy IP: The implementation principle of Easy IP is the same as that of NAPT. Easy IP translates IP addresses and transport-layer ports at the same time. The only difference is that Easy IP does not have the concept of address pool and uses the public IP address of the outbound interface as the translated address."
