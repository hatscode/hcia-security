          ],
          "correctAnswer": 0,
          "explanation": "- (1) Use phishing and malicious emails to intrude networks. - (2) After a host is intruded, various attack methods are used to spread in the target network to increase the number of controlled hosts. - (3) Steal data from controlled hosts and upload the data to a server controlled by attackers. - (4) Ultimately, one or more ransomware viruses are run to paralyze the target network for profit. Refer to page 12-15 of the Huawei Security Training material."

            "Right",
            "Wrong"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 0,
          "explanation": "In a Tracert packet attack, an attacker uses the ICMP Timeout packet returned when the TTL is 0 and the ICMP Port Unreachable packet returned when the packet reaches the destination address to discover the path through which the packet reaches the destination address. In this case, the attacker can spy on the network structure."

            "Connection-oriented",
            "Unreliable",
            "High overhead",
            "The application layer is responsible for reliability."
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 0,
          "explanation": "TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides connection-oriented and reliable byte stream services. Connection-oriented means that two applications using TCP must establish a TCP connection before exchanging data. TCP provides reliable transmission services through mechanisms such as acknowledgment, error checking, and data reassembly. However, these mechanisms introduce significant overhead. TCP is not unreliable; that characteristic applies to UDP (User Datagram Protocol). The application layer is not responsible for TCP's reliability; TCP itself ensures this through its own mechanisms."

        {
          "question": "Which of the following statements about the differences between MAC addresses and IP addresses are correct?",
          "options": [
            "A MAC address is a 48-bit physical address fixed on the device hardware and cannot be modified.",
            "An IP address is a 32-bit address at the network layer and can be modified.",
            "IP addresses are classified into public addresses and private addresses. Public addresses are globally unique, while private addresses can be reused within a LAN.",
            "The MAC address can be defined by common users and can be modified."
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 0,
          "explanation": "An IP address is a 32-bit logical address, not a hardware address. A hardware address, such as a 48-bit MAC address, is fixed in the network interface card (NIC) and used for communication between devices on the same link. The MAC address is globally unique, whereas IP addresses can be either public or private. Public IP addresses are globally unique, while private IP addresses can be reused within a LAN. The MAC address cannot be easily modified by common users."

            "Wrong"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a management protocol and provides information services for IP. ICMP messages are carried in IP packets. IGMP (Internet Group Management Protocol) is used for managing multicast group memberships and operates differently from ICMP."

          "question": "The TCP/IP protocol stack can be divided into seven layers, which are independent of each other.",
          "options": [
            "Right",
            "Wrong"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "The TCP/IP protocol stack consists of five layers, not seven. The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) reference model consists of seven layers. The layers in the TCP/IP model are: Application, Transport, Internet, Network Interface, and Physical. The layers in the OSI model are: Application, Presentation, Session, Transport, Network, Data Link, and Physical."

            "Routing Table",
            "MAC address table",
            "ARP table",
            "Session table"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 3,
          "explanation": "The firewall uses the session table to record the connection status of TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols. This table helps the firewall track and manage ongoing sessions, allowing it to forward packets based on their connection status. A session represents the connection status between two communication parties on the firewall."

            "Untrust",
            "Local"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 3,
          "explanation": "The Local zone, provided by the firewall, represents the firewall itself. This zone is used for handling packets that need to be responded to and processed by the firewall, rather than forwarded. Due to its unique role, security policies between the local zone and itself often need to be configured for applications requiring the device to send and receive packets."
        },
        {
          "question": "Which of the following zones is not the default security zone of the firewall?",

            "Right",
            "Wrong"
          ],
          "correctAnswer": 1,
          "explanation": "The basic design principle of a firewall is that traffic not explicitly allowed is discarded by default. This principle ensures that only permitted traffic is allowed through, thus protecting the network from unauthorized access and potential threats."

          ],
          "correctAnswer": 0,
          "explanation": "No-Port Address Translation (NAT No-PAT) translates only addresses and does not translate ports. In this way, one-to-one private address and one-to-one public address are translated. Easy IP: The implementation principle of Easy IP is the same as that of NAPT. Easy IP translates IP addresses and transport-layer ports at the same time. The only difference is that Easy IP does not have the concept of address pool and uses the public IP address of the outbound interface as the translated address."
